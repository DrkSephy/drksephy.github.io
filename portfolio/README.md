ACM Portfolio Creation
======================

This presentation will be held to help educate computer science/computer engineers in the ACM
as well as CCNY to build their own personal project portfolios. Having a personal portfolio
helps a job candidate stand out more than just having a plain resume, so the goal of this 
presentation is to provide a skeleton portfolio for personal use as well as discussing the
technology used to build it.

Technology Used
---------------

* JQuery (BxSlider plugin for image carousels)

* FullpageJS (Used for a vertical "slideshow" effect)

* Font Awesome / Glyphicons (Useful set of vector images)

* Slick (New Image Carosel)

* If time permits, an EmberJS / AngularJS portfolio will be created and discussed.
