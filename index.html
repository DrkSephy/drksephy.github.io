  <h2 style="text-align:center"> About Me </h2>

  <p>
    I am a Master's student at the City College of New York (CCNY) studying Computer Science and researcher at G.L.A.S.S. Lab under Professor Grossberg's lead. My research involves developing Web APIs and writing JavaScript for NOAA-CREST. Currently I am taking two classes: Formal Language Theory, and Compiler Construction where I will be developing a Pascal Compiler using Python/JavaScript.

  <h2 style="text-align:center"> Interests </h2>

  <p>
    As an undergradaute, I have dabbled in many fields of Computer Science: Cryptography, Web Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Game Development. My passion is Web Technology, where there is always much to explore in the world of JavaScript. With the emergence of node.js, express.js and angular.js, JavaScript is quickly becoming a must-have skill and there is always so much to learn.  
  </p>

  <p> 
    I am a huge advocate of open-source software. Github has essentially become my second home, where I am actively working on side projects and looking for ways to contribute to projects. My most recent contributions are to rust-by-example, which provides a handful of examples illustrating the usage of Rust and its advantages. Due to the Rust Compiler being bleeding edge, examples are quickly being deprecated and in need of being fixed. This has kept me on my toes and tracking changes frequently.
