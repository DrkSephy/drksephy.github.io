        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Welcome to my personal web page! My name is David, I am currently a senior
            studying Computer Engineering at the City College of New York. I'll be
            attending graduate school to further my studies in Computer Science. 
            I currently lead the CCNY ACM Game Development group. </p>

        <p>I started programming in 2009, my first language being C++. My areas of interest are Crytpography, Machine Learning, Web Development, Game Development and Computer Vision.</p>

        <p>I've worked on a few research projects, both in hardware and software. My 
            previous research experiences involved building customized quadcopters 
            used for creating 3D maps of urban areas, alongside software for processing
            and generating the map data gathered through cameras, sensors and lasers.</p>

        <h3>Project Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I like to work on a wide array of projects, ranging from web applications, web games and applications of cryptography. You can view my completed projects <a style="color:red" href="http://drksephy.github.io/portfolio/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>In Progress Works </h3>
        <p>In my free time, I work on a multitide of side projects to sharpen my skills and explore new technologies. These projects are often based around JavaScript and Python, but there are occasional projects with heavily revolve around mathematics and signal
        processing. You can view my in progress work <a style="color:red" href="http://drksephy.github.io/progress/">here</a>.</p>
