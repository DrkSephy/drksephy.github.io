        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Welcome to my personal web page! My name is David, and I am currently a graduate student studying Computer Science at the City College of New York (CCNY). As an undergraduate studying Computer Engineering, I was the vice-president of the CCNY chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, where I also led their Game Development group for that year. </p>

        <p>My areas of interest are Crytpography, Machine Learning, Web Technology, Game Development and Computer Vision.</p>

        <p>I've worked on a few research projects, both in hardware and software. My 
            previous research experiences involved building customized quadcopters 
            used for creating 3D maps of urban areas, alongside software for processing
            and generating the map data gathered through cameras, sensors and lasers.</p>

        <h3>Project Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I like to work on a wide array of projects, ranging from web applications, web games and applications of cryptography. You can view my completed projects <a style="color:red" href="http://drksephy.github.io/portfolio/">here</a>.</p>
