## What are we building? 

In this tutorial, we will be building a Django application from the ground up which will allow the user to query Github data through the use of a form. To build our application, we'll be using a wide array of technologies. We'll use <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)">pip</a> for Python package dependency management, <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> for front-end dependency management, <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> for design, <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> for making HTTP requests, the <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a> as our data source, and of course, <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. 

This tutorial assumes very little, so we'll cover the following concepts throughout:

* Model, View, Controllers (MVC)
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
* RESTful APIs
* Application flow within Django applications

The complete source for this project can be <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://github.com/DrkSephy/django-tutorial">found here</a>.

## Application Flow

The behavior of any Django Application (or web frameworks, in general) can be broken down as follows:

1. The user visits a URL, such as `/amazon/games`
2. This triggers a request to that URL, which is looked up in our URL dispatcher
3. The URL dispatcher will map this URL to a function within our Views
4. The corresponding View function will then access models, perform queries or fetch data as needed, which is bundled up and passed into a template
5. The data passed into the template is then displayed to the user using HTML

By following this flow, it becomes easier to reason about our applications even when they begin to grow larger and larger.

## Models, Views, Controllers 

The core structure of any web framework can be broken into three parts: the Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern allows developers to have a separation of concerns when building an application, and allows us to impose a logical structure to our projects. Let's go over these parts in more detail. 

### Models

Within a web framework, **Models** are your data layer. At any given time, your models will represent what your objects in your database will look like. For example, take a look at the following Django model shown below:

{% highlight python %}
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    age = models.IntegerField()
{% endhighlight %}

Where `first_name`, `last_name` and `age` will be fields in each `Student` object. Django provides easy to use validation methods through `CharField`, `IntegerField` and <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/models/">much more</a>, allowing model fields to only accept certain inputs.

Under the hood, Django will use these models to create <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">Structured Query Language</a>, which in turn will store these models into a SQL database (MySQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL). Using these methods, we won't have to write our own database logic using SQL. 


### Views

A view is typically a visual representation of our underlying data layer (models). Views can update models as well as retrieve data from them through a query, which in turn would be passed to an HTML template. 

In Django, views generally consist of a combination of templates, the URL dispatcher, and a `views.py` file. When a user navigates to a URL, a callback function is run which maps that particular url (such as `/games`) to a method named `games` within `views.py` which may in turn query models or some external API, and finally pass that data to a template using methods such as 
<a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/shortcuts/#render">render</a>.

### Controllers

In Django, controllers are generally described as the underlying mechanisms of the framework itself which sends web requests to the appropriate view in combination with the URL dispatcher. In a sense, Django is more of a "Model, Template, View" framework as there are no explicit "Controllers". 

### RESTful APIs

Without getting too deep into the meaning of "RESTful API", this term essentially means that there exists a web service which understands HTTP requests (GET, PUT/UPDATE, CREATE, DELETE). Any program that can send a web request (such as a Python program using the Requests library) can interact with these web service and receive data back in the form of either JSON or XML. This application will make use of the Requests library to send HTTP GET requests to Github's RESTful API which in turn will return JSON, which we will parse and render through an HTML template.

### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a way to store information in a lightweight, organized structure, containing a series of key/value pairs which can easily be parsed (extracted). 

JSON is used for websites such as Twitter, Facebook and Flickr to update asynchonously (without page reloads), and is the core in developing <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://drksephy.github.io/2015/02/21/fullstackjs/">full-stack JavaScript applications</a>. A sample snippet of JSON from Facebook can be seen below:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
{
   "data": [
      {
         "id": "X999_Y999",
         "from": {
            "name": "Tom Brady", "id": "X12"
         },
         "message": "Looking forward to 2010!",
         "actions": [
            {
               "name": "Comment",
               "link": "http://www.facebook.com/X999/posts/Y999"
            },
            {
               "name": "Like",
               "link": "http://www.facebook.com/X999/posts/Y999"
            }
         ],
         "type": "status",
         "created_time": "2010-08-02T21:27:44+0000",
         "updated_time": "2010-08-02T21:27:44+0000"
      },
      {
         "id": "X998_Y998",
         "from": {
            "name": "Peyton Manning", "id": "X18"
         },
         "message": "Where's my contract?",
         "actions": [
            {
               "name": "Comment",
               "link": "http://www.facebook.com/X998/posts/Y998"
            },
            {
               "name": "Like",
               "link": "http://www.facebook.com/X998/posts/Y998"
            }
         ],
         "type": "status",
         "created_time": "2010-08-02T21:27:44+0000",
         "updated_time": "2010-08-02T21:27:44+0000"
      }
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}


## Step 0: Installation

Before we can get started, we'll need to get some dependencies out of the way. To begin, we'll need to install the 
<a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">Python Package Manager</a>, `pip`. Mac, Linux and Windows users may <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html">refer here</a> for instructions for installing `pip`. 

<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> I highly recommend creating a <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">Virtual Environment</a>. These environments allow you to effectively "sandbox" python packages, which is great for development.</blockquote>

With `pip` in tow, we'll install the following dependencies:

* Django 
* Requests

To do so, simple run the following commands in your terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install django
$ pip install requests
{% endhighlight %}


With that all said and done, let's get into the development of the application.

### Step 1: Starting our project

To kick things off, let's create our Django project. Within your terminal:

{% highlight bash %}

$ django-admin startproject demonstration

{% endhighlight %}

Where **demonstration** is the name you choose for your own project. 

<blockquote><b>Warning:</b> Avoid using names such as <b>django</b> or <b>test</b>, these names will collide with built-in Python packages.</blockquote>

Let's take a look at our brand new project:

{% highlight bash %}

demonstration/
├── demonstration
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py

{% endhighlight %}

Breaking down each of these files:

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>demonstration/manage.py</b>: A command-line program allowing users to <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/">interact</a> with their Django applications. 

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>demonstration/demonstration/__init__.py</b>: An empty file signifying that this directory is considered
<a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages">a Python package</a>. 

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>demonstration/demonstration/settings.py</b>: A file consisting of key-value pairs for configuring your Django application. You can configure your databases, setup paths to static files, and <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/settings/">much more</a>.

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>demonstration/demonstration/urls.py</b>: Allows us to map view functions to URLs, which is essentially a table of contents for our application. You can read much more about it <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/">here</a>.

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>demonstration/demonstration/wsgi.py</b>: Allows us to deploy WSGI-compatible web servers, which you can read about more <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/">here</a>.

### Running the server

Django comes pre-packaged with it's own web server, which is pretty awesome. It allows us to run our application locally, and view any changes that we've made. To do so, let's go ahead and run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py runserver

{% endhighlight %}

When running this command, you'll be greeted with the following error in your terminal:

![Error](/img/djangotutorial/terminalerror.png){: .center-image}

Let's go ahead and fix that. You can stop the server using `Control + C` (`Command + C` on a Mac). Go ahead and run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py migrate

{% endhighlight %}

![Migrations](/img/djangotutorial/migrations.png){: .center-image}

This command will build all of the default database tables that Django needs for built-in services such as user authentication. For now, this isn't too relevant to us. 

<blockquote><b>Note:</b> This will generate a <b>db.sqlite3</b> database file, which would generally contain information regarding our models. For this project, we won't be dealing with the database.</blockquote>

Once again, we'll run the server:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py runserver

{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> and you'll be greeted with the nice shiny page:

![Success](/img/djangotutorial/itworked.png){: .center-image}

Great! You've run your first Django web application. However, as the message states, we haven't configured any URLs yet. We'll get to that shortly, but for now let's actually create our **application**.

### Step 2: Creating your application

You're probably thinking, "Didn't we already create our application?" Not quite, that was our project environment that we setup earlier. Within a Django Project, there can exist many "Applications", one of which we'll create right now:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py startapp app

{% endhighlight %}

Where **app** is the name you've chosen for this specific application. It is within this folder that we'll be writing a bulk of our code in, with the exception of modifying the base `urls.py` and `settings.py` file.

{% highlight bash %}
app/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── migrations
│   └── __init__.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
└── views.py
{% endhighlight %}

Breaking down these files:

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/admin.py</b>: Allows us to register our models to view on the <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/admin/">Django Admin Site</a>.

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/migrations</b>: Keeps track of our <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/migrations/">migrations</a> which are essentially Django's way of propagating changes that are made to our models. 

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/models.py</b>: Stores our representations of objects which will be stored in our database. 

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/tests.py</b>: Our <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/testing/">unit tests</a> will live here. Although Django calls these tests "unit tests", they're actually closer to integration tests. 

* <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/views.py</b>: All of our <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/views/">views</a> will live here, which are mapped to URLs. 


With that, we've successfully generated our project scaffold. Before moving on, we'll configure our `Settings.py` while which will be important going forward. 

### Configuring Settings.py 

`Settings.py` contains various configuration options available, such as <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/databases/">changing your database</a> and so <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/settings/">much more</a>. For this project, we'll need to add the following lines anywhere in this file:

{% highlight python %}
TEMPLATE_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')]
{% endhighlight %}

This will configure our paths for our Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc) as well as the path to our template files. 

Lastly, we'll need to register your application (named <b>app</b>) under the <b>Installed Apps</b> section:

{% highlight python %}
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'app',
)
{% endhighlight %}

We'll now move onto configuring a basic URL which will print out "Hello World".

### Step 3: Your First View 

As mentioned earlier, URLs map to functions in your `views.py` which in turn will pass data to a template. Within <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/views.py</b>:

{% highlight python %}

# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello World!')

{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> Python has a great <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">style guide</a>, which I highly recommend taking a look at. At the very least, learn to adopt not mixing tabs with spaces, which will make your code consistent and avoid errors when running your Python code.</blockquote>

In order to map urls to our view methods, we'll need to configure them. Within our root URLs file within the  <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i><b> demonstration</b> folder, we'll configure our urls to be proceeded by `app/`:

{% highlight python %}

# demonstration/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import include, url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
  url(r'^app/', include('app.urls')),
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
]

{% endhighlight %}

Now, our URLs may be accessed as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/<view url>`. We'll now create a new `urls.py` file within <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> <b>app/</b>: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ..
$ cd app
$ vim urls.py
{% endhighlight %}

And we'll add the following content: 

{% highlight python %}

# app/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import url

from app import views

urlpatterns = [
  url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
]

{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> You can read more about URL configuration <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/urls/">here</a>.</blockquote>

After configuring your <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i><b> app/urls.py </b> as shown, you should be prompted with the following response when you navigate to <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/app">http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/</a>:

![First View](/img/djangotutorial/helloworld.png){: .center-image}

We've successfully mapped the `/app/` url to the `index` function within <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i><b> app</b>/views.py. Pretty simple, right? At this point,
can you see the application flow that we described earlier? To further emphasize this, try and see if you can create a new url, map it to your view, and display the string `My second view!` on your own. We'll include the code to do so below:

{% highlight python %}

# app/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import url

from app import views

urlpatterns = [
  url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
  url(r'^test/$', views.test, name='test'),
]

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}

# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
import requests

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello World!')

def test(request):
    return HttpResponse('My second view!')

{% endhighlight %}

If we navigate to <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/test/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/test/</a>, you should be greeted with the text "My second view!".

Alright, you should be getting the hang of it now. We've been making some toy views, but how about we move onto displaying some meaningful data to the user? In particular, we'll display the Github profile information for a given user. 

### Step 4: Integrating the Github API

The Github API contains a collection of URLs which a developer can query using HTTP methods to retrieve data, in the form of JSON. In order to leverage this API, we'll use the Python Requests library which will make this process simple. From the API for users, we can get profile information by using the following URL:

{% highlight bash %}

https://api.github.com/users/:user

{% endhighlight %}

Where **:user** is the name of the Github user you'd like to query profile information about. Before we display this data in Django, I highly encourage you to open up a terminal shell and try the following:

{% highlight Python %}

$ python
>>> import requests
>>> req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy')
>>> print req.content

{% endhighlight %}

You should be presented with the following data:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "login": "DrkSephy",
    "id": 1226900,
    "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226900?v=3",
    "gravatar_id": "",
    "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/DrkSephy",
    "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/followers",
    "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/following{/other_user}",
    "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/gists{/gist_id}",
    "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/starred{/owner}{/repo}",
    "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/subscriptions",
    "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/orgs",
    "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/repos",
    "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/events{/privacy}",
    "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy/received_events",
    "type": "User",
    "site_admin": false,
    "name": "David Leonard",
    "company": "Yahoo!",
    "blog": "http://drksephy.github.io",
    "location": "Sunnyvale, California",
    "email": "DrkSephy1025@gmail.com",
    "hireable": false,
    "bio": null,
    "public_repos": 68,
    "public_gists": 5,
    "followers": 127,
    "following": 6,
    "created_at": "2011-11-29T01:15:27Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-07-17T13:17:54Z"
}
{% endhighlight %}

As easy as that, we performed an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint and received JSON back. Let's go ahead and wire this up in Django. As an exercise, try to create the urls and view method yourself before moving forward. 

{% highlight python %}

# app/urls.py 

from django.conf.urls import url

from app import views

urlpatterns = [
  url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
  url(r'^test/$', views.test, name='test'),
  url(r'^profile/$', views.profile, name='profile'),
]

{% endhighlight %}

Going forward, we'll need a method to load json strings easily. Be sure to `import json` as shown in the code snippet below:

{% highlight python %}
# views.py 

from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
import requests
import json

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello World!')

def test(request):
    return HttpResponse('My second view!')

def profile(request):
    req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy')
    content = req.text
    return HttpResponse(content)

{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/profile">http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/profile</a> and you'll be greeted with the following response:

![More JSON](/img/djangotutorial/morejson.png){: .center-image}

At the moment, the output is kind of messy. Let's update our view `profile` view to bundle up the values in the JSON that we are interested in displaying to the user:

{% highlight python %}

def profile(request):
    jsonList = []
    req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy')
    jsonList.append(json.loads(req.content))
    parsedData = []
    userData = {}
    for data in jsonList:
    userData['name'] = data['name']
        userData['blog'] = data['blog']
        userData['email'] = data['email']
        userData['public_gists'] = data['public_gists']
        userData['public_repos'] = data['public_repos']
        userData['avatar_url'] = data['avatar_url']
        userData['followers'] = data['followers']
        userData['following'] = data['following']
    parsedData.append(userData)
    return HttpResponse(parsedData)

{% endhighlight %}

Which will return the new response:

![Parsed JSON](/img/djangotutorial/parsedjson.png){: .center-image}

As of now, we've covered a bunch of topics in only < 30 lines of Python. Let's take a moment to recap what we've learned:

* Creating our project structure
* Learned the basics of MVC
* Mapping our URLs 
* Writing several view methods
* APIs, and how to query data using Requests
* Displaying data to the user

You might be thinking that our design leaves plenty to be desired. If so, you're right. We'll use the Twitter Bootstrap library to spruce things up within a template, but before that we'll install Bower to grab our front-end dependencies.

### Bower

<a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> is a front-end dependency manager for your project. In laymans terms, it is a command-line program which you can utilize to download libraries such as <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. The beauty of this approach is that we can generate a `bower.json` file, which any user can copy and use to download a bunch of packages easily - as opposed to going to each site, and manually copy/pasting/saving out files. 

In this step, I'll walk you through downloading Twitter bootstrap as well as generating your own `bower.json`. Before we do this, we'll create a `.bowerrc` file.

In the same directory as `manage.py`, create a `.bowerrc` file with the following content:

{% highlight bash %}
{
    "directory": "app/static/"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Anytime we run `bower`, it will output the downloaded files within the directory listed here. 

<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> There is a huge array of <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://bower.io/docs/config/">configuration options</a> which can be used, for those curious.</blockquote>


And now in our command line, we can simply run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ bower install bootstrap
{% endhighlight %}

This will download Twitter Bootstrap into our project directory,  as specified within our `.bowerrc` file. 

### Step 5: Templating

Templates in Django are essentially HTML files which we pass in a context which then renders our data to the user. Before we can create our first template, we'll need to create some folders. In the same directory as your <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i><b> app</b>/views.py:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir templates
$ mkdir templates/app
$ cd templates/app
{% endhighlight %}

Within our <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i><b>templates/app</b> folder, we'll create our `profile.html`:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="/static/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>

            <tbody>
            {% raw %}
            {% for key in data %}
                <tr>
                    <td>{{ key.name }}</td>
                    <td>{{ key.blog }}</td>
                    <td>{{ key.public_repos }}</td>
                    <td>{{ key.public_gists }}</td>

{% endhighlight %}

Most of this is just Bootstrap classes for styling, but there is one important syntax to observe here:

{% highlight html %}
  {% raw %}
    {% for key in data %}
{% endfor %}
  {% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This syntax allows us to iterate over a data structure using a `for` loop, which should look familiar. Within this `for` loop, we do the following:

{% highlight html %}
  {% raw %}
    {{ key.name }}
{{ key.blog }}
{{ key.public_repos }}
    ...
  {% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, `data` is an array of dictionaries, in which each dictionary has the `name`, `blog`, and `public_repos` keys (and a few others, listed in the above snippet for brevity). Here we access these properties and display them using the double curly braces syntax, which are template varaible placeholders which will take on the value of the expression within.

With this new template in hand, let's reload our `profile` page:

![Bootstrap Table](/img/djangotutorial/bootstrap.png){: .center-image}

Awesome, we've got a nice layout. As of now, our view method is essentially hardcoded - we can't query any particular user's Github information. We'll need to come up with a way to ask the user for an input, and to do this we'll move onto forms.

### Step 6: Forms 

Forms are the bread and butter of web applications - every web programmer will come across them at one point or another. Forms essentially allow users to interact with your web application through various fields for input, usually for registration pages or in our case, performing a query. 

To begin, we'll go ahead and build our form within our `profile.html`:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<style>
  .form-signin {
    max-width: 550px;
    padding: 15px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }    
</style>


<div class="container text-center">
    <form class="form-signin" id="login_form" method="post" action="/app/profile/">
      {% csrf_token %}

      <br>
      <input type="text" name="user" class="form-control" placeholder="Github User Name, e.g: DrkSephy" value="" required autofocus>
      <br>
      <button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit">Get Data</button>
    </form>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's break this down in pieces:

{% highlight html %}
<style>
  .form-signin {
    max-width: 550px;
    padding: 15px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }    
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

This is simply a CSS class which we'll use to style our form with.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="container text-center">
    <form class="form-signin" method="post" action="/app/profile/">
        ...
    </form>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Here we are creating our `form` element which is styled by our CSS class using:

{% highlight html %}
<form class="form-signin" ... >
{% endhighlight %}

We're also specifying the type of HTTP method this form will perform after submission:

{% highlight html %}
<form ... method="post" ... >
{% endhighlight %}

Once we submit our form, it will perform an HTTP post request which will send the input that the user inputs as parameters to the following url: 

{% highlight html %}
<form ... ... action="/app/profile/">
{% endhighlight %}

Where `/app/profile/` is our view function which will handle the POST request.

{% highlight html %}
{% csrf_token %}
{% endhighlight %}

The `csrf_token` will protect against any <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/csrf/">cross site forgery</a> attacks.

Next, we look at our input field:

{% highlight html %}
<input type="text" name="user" class="form-control" placeholder="Github User Name, e.g: DrkSephy" required autofocus>
{% endhighlight %}

Which has the following attributes:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- The type of input the field is expecting -->
<input type="text" ... >
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<!-- This key/value pair will be sent as a POST parameter upon submission -->
<input ... name="user" ... >
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<!-- placeholder text for the form field -->
<input ... placeholder="Github User Name, e.g: DrkSephy" ... >
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<!-- make a blue border around the form field when user has clicked to type -->
<input ... required autofocus>
{% endhighlight %}

The most important attribute to pay attention to is `name=user`. This `name` parameter will have it's value `user` sent as a POST parameter once the user submits the form, which we'll get into shortly. The last bit for our form is the actual submission, which will be a button:

{% highlight html %}
<button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit">Get Data</button>
{% endhighlight %}

Where we provide attributes specifying the bootstrap styling class `btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block`, as well as the type of action to perform when this button is clicked (in this case, a `submit` action.) Once this button is clicked, the form will be submitted and the values from it's form fields (here we only have one form field) will be sent as a POST request to the corresponding URL set earlier.

Putting it all together:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="/static/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="text-center"> Github User Data </h1>
  <div class="col-lg-12">
      <style>
        .form-signin {
          max-width: 550px;
          padding: 15px;
          margin: 0 auto;
        }    
      </style>


      <div class="container text-center">
          <form class="form-signin" id="login_form" method="post" action="/app/profile/">
            {% raw %}
            {% csrf_token %}
            {% endraw %}

            <br>
            <input type="text" name="user" class="form-control" placeholder="Github User Name, e.g: DrkSephy" value="" required autofocus>
            <br>
            <button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit">Get Data</button>
          </form>
      </div>
      <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped tablesorter">
              <thead>
              <tr>
                <th class="header"> Username <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                <th class="header"> Blog <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                <th class="header"> Public Repos <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                <th class="header"> Public Gists <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                <th class="header"> Email <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                <th class="header"> Followers <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                <th class="header"> Following <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          
          {% raw %}
          {% for key in data %}
              <tr>
                  <td>{{ key.name }}</td>
                  <td>{{ key.blog }}</td>
                  <td>{{ key.public_repos }}</td>
                  <td>{{ key.public_gists }}</td>
                  <td>{{ key.email }}</td>
                  <td>{{ key.followers }}</td>
                  <td>{{ key.following }}</td>
              </tr>
          {% endfor %}
          {% endraw %}
          
          </tbody>
          </table>
      </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we'll learn how to capture these POST parameters in our views and use them. 

### Step 7: Capturing POST parameters

As mentioned, performing a POST request will send parameters that can be accessed programmatically. Let's modify our `profile`method within <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i><b>app</b>/views.py to access the `user` value that was passed through our form submission:

{% highlight python %}
def profile(request):
    parsedData = []
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.POST.get('user')
        req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/' + username)
        jsonList = []
        jsonList.append(json.loads(req.content))
        userData = {}
        for data in jsonList:
            userData['name'] = data['name']
            userData['blog'] = data['blog']
            userData['email'] = data['email']
            userData['public_gists'] = data['public_gists']
            userData['public_repos'] = data['public_repos']
            userData['avatar_url'] = data['avatar_url']
            userData['followers'] = data['followers']
            userData['following'] = data['following']
        parsedData.append(userData)
    return render(request, 'app/profile.html', {'data': parsedData})
{% endhighlight %}

Most of the code is exactly the same, but we'll break down the new additions in pieces:

{% highlight python %}
if request.method == 'POST':
{% endhighlight %}

If our `profile` method was accessed through a `POST` request, this condition will be true. Likewise, we could write additional logic to handle cases for `GET`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` requests here based on the type of request we specified in our form. 

{% highlight python %}
username = request.POST.get('user')
{% endhighlight %}

Here we actually access our POST parameters. From our form, we know that our single field had an attribute of `name` with a corresponding value `user`, which was passed upon form submission. We'll use this value to build a request url:

{% highlight python %}
req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/' + username)
{% endhighlight %}

And the rest is the same as before. Using the new parameterized url, it will grab the Github profile information for a given username as passed through our form. Go ahead and try putting in various usernames of your friends on Github! 

I hope this guide has been helpful for beginners (and possibly non-beginners). I'll be exploring more complicated tech stacks using Django + ReactJS in the near future, so stay tuned for more tutorials.
