Django is a popular Python web framework which gives developers the power to develop their own web applications. In this tutorial, we will be building a Django application from the ground up which will allow the user to query Github data through the use of a form. We'll be covering the following topics:

* Starting a Django Application
* Project structure breakdown
* Configuring a proper development environment
* Python Requests library
* MVC (Models - Views - Contollers)
* Querying an API using Python Requests library
* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

If you aren't familiar with these topics, don't sweat it. We'll cover these topics in detail which will get you up to speed in no time. 

### Models, Views, Controllers 

The core structure of any web framework can be broken into three parts: the Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern allows developers to have a separation of concerns when building an application, and allows us to impose a logical structure to our projects. Let's go over these parts in more detail. 

#### Models

Within a web framework, **Models** are your data layer. At any given time, your models will represent what your objects in your database will look like. For example, take a look at the following Django model shown below:

Sample model
Description of Model

But how do we store these models in our database? Simple enough, Django provides abstractions for turning our models into database entries with the use of a few simple commands:

Database commands
Database command explanations

Under the hood, Django is using these models to programmatically return SQL, which in turn will store these models into a SQL database (MySQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL). Using these methods, we won't have to write our own database logic using SQL. 


#### Views

Views generally consist of a combination of templates and a URL dispatcher. In Django, we are provided with the ability to write templates (which are essentially HTML files) coupled with template variables which will get passed in through our controller. 


#### Controllers

Controllers have one main purpose: to operate on our data layer and return this data to our templates, which will generate HTML content to the user. In Django, we typically write our controllers within a `views.py` file. 

With this terminology out of the way, let's talk about general application flow in a given Django application.


#### Application Flow

The behavior of any Django Application (or web frameworks, in general) can be broken down as follows:

1. The user visits a URL, such as `/amazon/games`
2. This triggers a request to that URL, which is looked up in our URL dispatcher
3. The URL dispatcher will map this URL to a function within our Views
4. The View function will then access models, perform queries or fetch data as needed, which is bundled up and passed into a template
5. The data passed into the template is then emitted to the user

By following this flow, it becomes easier to reason about our applications even when they begin to grow larger and larger.

In this application, we won't be making extensive use of Models. Instead, we'll be building out a sample URL which the user can visit to query their public user information on Github using their RESTful API. Once this initial task is done, we'll refactor our code and provide a form in which the user can enter in a username of anyone on Github and display their information through a template. 

With that all said and done, let's get into the development of the application.


#### Starting our application

To kick things off, let's create our Django project. Within your terminal:

{% highlight bash %}

$ django-admin startproject demonstration

{% endhighlight %}

Where **demonstration** is the name you choose for your own project. 

<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> Avoid using names such as django or test, these names will collide with built-in Python packages.</blockquote>

Let's take a look at our brand new project:

{% highlight bash %}

demonstration/
├── demonstration
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py

{% endhighlight %}

#### Running the server

Django comes pre-packaged with it's own web server, which is pretty awesome. It allows us to run our application locally, and view any changes that we've made. To do so, let's go ahead and run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py runserver

{% endhighlight %}

When running this command, you'll be greeted with the following error in your terminal:

![Error](/img/djangotutorial/terminalerror.png){: .center-image}

Let's go ahead and fix that. You can stop the server using `Control-C` (`Command-C` on a Mac). Go ahead and run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py migrate

{% endhighlight %}

![Migrations](/img/djangotutorial/migrations.png){: .center-image}

This command will build all of the default database tables that Django needs for built-in services such as user authentication. For now, this isn't too relevant to us. Once again, we'll run the server:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py runserver

{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you'll be greeted with the nice shiny page:

![Success](/img/djangotutorial/itworked.png){: .center-image}

Great! You've run your first Django web application. However, as the message states, we haven't configured any URLs yet. We'll get to that shortly, but for now let's actually create our **application**

#### Creating your application

You're probably thinking, "Didn't we already create our application?" Not quite, that was our project environment that we setup earlier. Within a Django Project, there can exist many "Applications", one of which we'll create right now:

{% highlight bash %}

$ python manage.py app

{% endhighlight %}

Where **app** is the name you've chosen for this specific application. It is within this folder that we'll be writing a bulk of our code in, with the exception of modifying the base `urls.py` and `settings.py` file.

{% highlight bash %}
app/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── migrations
│   └── __init__.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
└── views.py
{% endhighlight %}

With that, we've successfully generated our project scaffold. We'll now move onto configuring a basic URL which will print out "Hello World".

#### Your First View 

As mentioned earlier, URLs map to functions in your `views.py` which in turn will pass data to a template. Within your `views.py`:

{% highlight python %}

# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse('Hello World!')

{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> Python has a great <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">style guide</a>, which I highly recommend taking a look at. At the very least, learn to adopt not mixing tabs with spaces, which will make your code consistent and avoid errors when running your Python code. I personally use 4 spaces to indent each block, but you may choose tabs. You can set your tab width within your text editor (like Sublime) to 4 spaces per tab.</blockquote>

{% highlight python %}

# demonstration/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^app/', include('app.urls')),
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}

# app/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import patterns, url

from app import views

urlpatterns = patterns('',
	url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
)

{% endhighlight %}

After configuring your URLs as shown, you should be prompted with the following response when you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/:

![First View](/img/djangotutorial/helloworld.png){: .center-image}

We've successfully mapped the `/app/` url to the `index` function within `views.py`. Pretty simple, right? At this point,
can you see the application flow that we described earlier? To further emphasize this, try and see if you can create a new url, map it to your view, and display the string `My second view!` on your own. We'll include the code to do so below:

{% highlight python %}

# app/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import patterns, url

from app import views

urlpatterns = patterns('',
	url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	url(r'^testing/$', views.test, name='test'),
)

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}

# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
import requests

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse('Hello Lisa! I love you! Marry me?! @_@')

def test(request):
	return HttpResponse('My second view!')

{% endhighlight %}

Alright, you should be getting the hang of it now. We've been making some toy views, but how about we move onto displaying some meaningful data to the user? In particular, we'll display the Github profile information for a given user. 

#### Github API

The Github API contains a collection of URLs which a developer can query using HTTP methods to retrieve data, in the form of JSON. In order to leverage this API, we'll use the Python Requests library which will make this process simple. From the API for users, we can get profile information by using the following URL:

{% highlight bash %}

https://api.github.com/users/:user

{% endhighlight %}

Where **:user** is the name of the Github user you'd like to query profile information about. Before we display this data in Django, I highly encourage you to open up a terminal shell and try the following:

{% highlight Python %}

$ python
>>> import requests
>>> req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy')
>>> print req.content

{% endhighlight %}

You should be presented with the following data:

![JSON Response](/img/djangotutorial/json.png){: .center-image}

As easy as that, we performed an HTTP GET request to the endpoint `https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy` and received JSON back. Let's go ahead and wire this up in Django. As an exercise, try to create the urls and view method yourself before moving forward. 

{% highlight python %}

# urls.py 

from django.conf.urls import patterns, url

from app import views

urlpatterns = patterns('',
	url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
	url(r'^testing/$', views.test, name='test'),
	url(r'^profile/$', views.profile, name='profile'),
)

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
# views.py 

from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
import requests

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse('Hello Lisa! I love you! Marry me?! @_@')

def test(request):
	return HttpResponse('My second view!')

def profile(request):
	req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy')
	content = req.text
	return HttpResponse(content)

{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/profile/` and you'll be greeted with the following response:

![More JSON](/img/djangotutorial/morejson.png){: .center-image}

At the moment, the output is kind of messy. Let's update our view `profile` view to bundle up the values in the JSON that we are interested in displaying to the user:

{% highlight python %}

def profile(request):
	jsonList = []
	req = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users/DrkSephy')
	jsonList.append(json.loads(req.content))
	parsedData = []
	userData = {}
	for data in jsonList:
		userData['name'] = data['name']
        userData['blog'] = data['blog']
        userData['email'] = data['email']
        userData['public_gists'] = data['public_gists']
        userData['public_repos'] = data['public_repos']
        userData['avatar_url'] = data['avatar_url']
        userData['followers'] = data['followers']
        userData['following'] = data['following']
	parsedData.append(userData)
	return HttpResponse(parsedData)

{% endhighlight %}

Which will return the new response:

![Parsed JSON](/img/djangotutorial/parsedjson.png){: .center-image}

As of now, we've covered a bunch of topics in only < 30 lines of Python. Let's take a moment to recap what we've learned:

* Creating our project structure
* Learned the basics of MVC
* Mapping our URLs 
* Writing several view methods
* APIs, and how to query data using Requests
* Displaying data to the user

You might be thinking that our design leaves plenty to be desired. If so, you're right. We'll use the Twitter Bootstrap library to spruce things up, but first we'll dive into Bower.

#### Bower

Bower is a front-end dependency manager for your project. In laymans terms, it is a command-line program which you can utilize to download libraries such as Twitter Bootstrap. The beauty of this approach is that we can generate a `bower.json` file, which any user can copy and use to download a bunch of packages easily - as opposed to going to each site, and manually copy/pasting/saving out files. I'll walk you through downloading Twitter bootstrap as well as generating your own `bower.json`. Before we do this, we'll create a `.bowerrc` file.

{% highlight bash %}
{
	"directory": "demonstration/app/static/"
}
{% endhighlight %}

And now in our command line, we can simple:

{% highlight bash %}
$ bower install bootstrap
{% endhighlight %}

Afterwards, we can now generate our `bower.json` by running:

{% highlight bash %}
$ bower init 
{% endhighlight %}

This will prompt you with various configuration questions, which you may answer as you please. However, when prompted with **[?] set currently installed components as dependencies?**, be sure to select **Yes**. At the end of this process, the following `bower.json` file will be generated for you (with some values for authors, homepage, etc differing based on your own configuration):

{% highlight bash %}

{
  "name": "demonstration",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/DrkSephy/",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "~3.3.5"
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

With this in place, we now have access to the Twitter Bootstrap library. 

#### Our first template

Templates in Django are essentially HTML files which we pass in a context which then renders our data to the user. Before we can create our first template, we'll need to create some folders. In the same directory as your `views.py`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir templates
$ mkdir templates/app
$ cd templates/app
{% endhighlight %}

Within our `templates/app` folder, we'll create our **`profile.html`**:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="/static/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
    	<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1 class="text-center"> Github User Data </h1>
    	<div class="col-lg-12">
            <div class="table-responsive">
                <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-striped tablesorter">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                    <th class="header"> Username <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    <th class="header"> Blog <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    <th class="header"> Public Repos <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    <th class="header"> Public Gists <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    <th class="header"> Email <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    <th class="header"> Followers <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    <th class="header"> Following <i class="icon-sort"></i></th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>

                {% for key in data %}
                    <tr>
                        <td>{{ key.name }}</td>
                        <td>{{ key.blog }}</td>
                        <td>{{ key.public_repos }}</td>
                        <td>{{ key.public_gists }}</td>
                        <td>{{ key.email }}</td>
                        <td>{{ key.followers }}</td>
                        <td>{{ key.following }}</td>
        			</tr>
                {% endfor %}

                </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>
	</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

With this new template in hand, let's reload our `profile` page:
