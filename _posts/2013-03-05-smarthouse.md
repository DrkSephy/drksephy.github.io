A plug-and-play device allowing remote control of any application connected to it through the use of an iOS application. Through the use of custom hardware built on top of an Arduino Mega coupled with a central server backed by a node.js API, users can set up devices on the included iOS application and toggle the power status of any connected device.

#### Motivation

The motivation for this project is to help assist visually impaired and physically disabled persons control their home through the ease of our application and hardware, as part of our final one-year project as seniors in Computer Engineering.
