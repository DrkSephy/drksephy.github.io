In my Artificial Intelligence class, we were given a project in which we had to use Genetic Algorithms in order to solve the following problem:

<blockquote>Develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the following problem: Given a list of n distinct positive integers, partition the list into two sublists, each of size n/2, such that the difference between the sums of the integers in the two sublists is minimized. To obtain your initial list, use a linear congruential random number generator to generate 100 random integers between 1 and 10,000.</blockquote>
