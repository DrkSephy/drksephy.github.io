Super Mario World - Koopa Krisis is a JavaScript remake of Super Mario World, built on top of the ImpactJS Game Engine, purely for educational purposes. The motivation of this project is to create a browser-only version of one of the most iconic games in the history of Nintendo, and to further my knowledge of JavaScript and the ImpactJS framework.

#### Motivation 

As the new leader of CCNY ACM's Game Development group for the Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 year, I decided to experiment with the ImpactJS Game Engine after being exposed to it in Fall 2012. I decided to begin working on a simple platformer game in late July, which soon turned out to be heavily based on Super Mario World. My motivation was to create a skeleton game which others could build on top of, and to produce a well polished game at the end of the Fall 2013 semester. Once our Game Development club meetings started, I assembled a team of 5 others and development began. 

#### Development Roadmap

My team this semester was very enthusiastic about this game, and so I knew that a detailed listing of all tasks needed to be done. After spending a session explaining the game engine, basic JavaScript and how projects are structured using ImpactJS, my group quickly caught on and started to work on their respective tasks. A list of comprehensive tasks are shown below:

* Artificial Intelligence of Enemies
    * Understanding the ImpactJS Game loop 
    * Graphics for Enemies
* Powerup System
    * Various powerups
    * Powerup transitions when getting hit
* Collectible Items
    * Coins
    * Free lives
* Ability to transition between levels
    * Ability to have different songs per level
* Ability to use pipes to transition to levels
* Sloped tile movement
* Level building
    * Asset gathering

I decided to give each member of my team 1-2 different enemies each week to work on, while providing a skeleton file containing the animation frames already set up, as well as detailed descriptions of enemy behavior coupled with videos of demonstration for those not familiar with Super Mario World. In the meantime, I would work on various systems such as the powerups, collectible items, level building and other things critical to the gameplay itself.

#### Understanding the ImpactJS Game Loop

To discuss creating enemy AI, we must first understand ImpactJS's game loop. Any object that can interact within the game's environment is called an `entity`, and therefore creating new enemies is the same as creating a new entity. Each entity has their own base methods which can be extended. To make our codebase modular, we created a base entity named `basic_ai.js` which contains these methods, allowing us to extend from it and have our new entities inherit the properties from `basic_ai.js` and drastically make our codebase more readable. The following is a listing of the important methods found within our `basic_ai.js` module:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
    
    init: function(x, y, settings) {
            // Init method is used for setting up animations
            // and temporary variables
            this.parent(x, y, settings);

            // Set up animations
            /** Animations should be handled by each enemy. **/
            this.healthTimer = new ig.Timer();
            tempHealth = this.health;
            // Load player object if not in Weltmeister
            if(!ig.global.wm)
                my_player = ig.game.getEntitiesByType('EntityPlayer')[0];
        }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
     // handleMovementTrace is mostly for checking collisions
     // against other entities in conjunction with the 
     // `collidesWith method.
     handleMovementTrace: function(res) {
            this.parent(res);

            // If the enemy collides with a wall, make them turn around.
            if(res.collision.x) {
                this.flip = !this.flip;
                this.currentAnim.flip.x = this.flip;
            }
        }, 
    
{% endhighlight%}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
    // Collisions with player are handled through the following function.
        /** Certain enemies with advanced collisions may wish to override this
            function with their own collision handling code. **/
        collideWith: function(other, axis) {
            // Only do something if colliding with the Player
            if(other instanceof EntityPlayer) {
                // Prevents enemy from being killed from below.
                if(axis == 'y' && this.pos.y > other.pos.y) {
                    other.vel.y = this.damage_jump;
                    this.kill();
                } else {
                    other.receiveDamage(this.collide_damage, this);
                    // Push player back if collides with enemy horizontally.
                    if(other.pos.x > this.pos.x)
                        other.vel.x = this.damage_push;
                    else
                        other.vel.x = -this.damage_push;
                }
                
                // If player's health <= 0 (player dead), re-detect player
                // entity (respawned player).
                if(other.health <= 0)
                    my_player = ig.game.getEntitiesByType('EntityPlayer')[0];
            }
        },
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
    // Simply setting up collisions isn't enough, we must create a method
    // which will check if a collision occurs. This method overrides the
    // .check() function, which gets called when a collision is detected,
    // and applies damage to the entity it collides with.
    check: function(other, axis) {
            if(other instanceof EntityPlayer)
                if(axis == 'x')
                    other.receiveDamage(this.collide_damage, this);
        },
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
    // Enemy's death (and player's rewards from enemy's death) is handled
    // through the following function.
        kill: function() {
            ig.game.stats.kills++;
            ig.game.increaseScore(this.kill_score);
            ig.game.spawnEntity(EntityDeathExplosionParticle, this.pos.x, this.pos.y, {particles:2, colorOffset: 1});
            this.parent();
        },
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
    // Enemy receiving damage is handled through the following function.
        receiveDamage: function(value) {
            this.parent(value);
            this.healthTimer.set(0);
        }
{% endhighlight %}

With these methods written, there only remains two methods needed to implement: `draw()` and `update()`. Both of these methods are called on every frame of the game, and the `update()` method contains the meat of manipulating an entity through various properties. Due to the behavior of the `update()` method, we create methods such as `init()` which will initialize the variables and properties needed by the entity, such as flags denoting when to attack or when to follow a player.
