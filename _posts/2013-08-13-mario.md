Super Mario World - Koopa Krisis is a JavaScript remake of Super Mario World, built on top of the ImpactJS Game Engine, purely for educational purposes. The motivation of this project is to create a browser-only version of one of the most iconic games in the history of Nintendo, and to further my knowledge of JavaScript and the ImpactJS framework.

#### Motivation 

As the new leader of CCNY ACM's Game Development group for the Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 year, I decided to experiment with the ImpactJS Game Engine after being exposed to it in Fall 2012. I decided to begin working on a simple platformer game in late July, which soon turned out to be heavily based on Super Mario World. My motivation was to create a skeleton game which others could build on top of, and to produce a well polished game at the end of the Fall 2013 semester. Once our Game Development club meetings started, I assembled a team of 5 others and development began. 

#### Development Roadmap

My team this semester was very enthusiastic about this game, and so I knew that a detailed listing of all tasks needed to be done. After spending a session explaining the game engine, basic JavaScript and how projects are structured using ImpactJS, my group quickly caught on and started to work on their respective tasks. A list of comprehensive tasks are shown below:

* Artificial Intelligence of Enemies
    * Understanding the ImpactJS Game loop 
    * Graphics for Enemies
* Powerup System
    * Various powerups
    * Powerup transitions when getting hit
* Collectible Items
    * Coins
    * Free lives
* Ability to transition between levels
    * Ability to have different songs per level
* Ability to use pipes to transition to levels
* Sloped tile movement
* Level building
    * Asset gathering
