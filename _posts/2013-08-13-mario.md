<a style="color:red" href="http://drksephy.bitbucket.org/">Super Mario World - Koopa Krisis</a> is a JavaScript remake of Super Mario World, built on top of the <a style="color:red" href="http://impactjs.com/">ImpactJS Game Engine</a>, purely for educational purposes. The motivation of this project is to create a replica of one of most iconic games in the history of Nintendo, and to further my knowledge of JavaScript and the ImpactJS framework.

#### Project Conception 

As the new leader of CCNY ACM's Game Development group for the Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 year, I decided to experiment with the ImpactJS Game Engine after being exposed to it in Fall 2012. I decided to begin working on a simple platformer game in late July, based on Super Mario World. My motivation was to create a skeleton game which others could build on top of, and to produce a well polished game at the end of the Fall 2013 semester. Once our Game Development club meetings started, I assembled a team of 5 others and development began. 

#### Roles and Development 

As the project leader, I began with introducing my teammates to ImpactJS and JavaScript by going over the existing codebase. During this time, I explained the architecture of the framework, the existing features of the game, and the progression of features to come. After this, I delegated tasks weekly, maintained the codebase through refactoring, and addressed any questions and concerns of my teammates. Aside from that, my contributions to this project are shown below:  

<ul>
    <li> Coin / Life System </li>
    <li> Heads Up Display (HUD) </li>
    <li> Expansive Item System </li>
    <li> Dynamic camera system </li>
    <li> Enemy Artificial Intelligence </li>
    <li> Development of Powerup System </li>
    <li> Level Design / Overworld Design</li>
    <li> Checkpoint system for saving progress </li>
    <li> Gathering of assets (Musical, Graphical) </li>
    <li> Development of wide array of player abilities </li>
</ul>


#### Challenges and Experiences

Overall, Super Mario World Koopa Krisis was a huge success. Along with my group, I gained a lot of experience with JavaScript and learned more of the advantages of Object Oriented Programming firsthand, along with becoming more familiar with the ImpactJS Game Engine. 

The biggest challenges faced during this project revolved around transitioning between different game states (a main game and an overworld state), as well as working around the limitations of ImpactJS's `sound` class. One big challenge I personally faced was leading a large group and being able to break down tasks to their most basic form, as well as giving primer lessons on the game engine and JavaScript. In the end, it was a great experience for me as a leader on a project and helped push me to write clean, efficient code for others to understand, while learning as much as possible to pass it on to my dedicated members. 

In the end, our group stayed together and we decided to tackle a far more complex game, a remake of Fire Emblem - Blazing Sword from the Game Boy Advanced.
