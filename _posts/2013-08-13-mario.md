<a style="color:red" href="http://drksephy.bitbucket.org/">Super Mario World - Koopa Krisis</a> is a JavaScript remake of Super Mario World, built on top of the <a style="color:red" href="http://impactjs.com/">ImpactJS Game Engine</a>, purely for educational purposes. The motivation of this project is to create a replica of one of most iconic games in the history of Nintendo, and to further my knowledge of JavaScript and the ImpactJS framework.

#### Motivation 

As the new leader of CCNY ACM's Game Development group for the Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 year, I decided to experiment with the ImpactJS Game Engine after being exposed to it in Fall 2012. I decided to begin working on a simple platformer game in late July, which soon turned out to be heavily based on Super Mario World. My motivation was to create a skeleton game which others could build on top of, and to produce a well polished game at the end of the Fall 2013 semester. Once our Game Development club meetings started, I assembled a team of 5 others and development began. 

#### Development Roadmap

My team this semester was very enthusiastic about this game, and so I knew that a detailed listing of all tasks needed to be done. After spending a session explaining the game engine, basic JavaScript and how projects are structured using ImpactJS, my group quickly caught on and started to work on their respective tasks. A list of comprehensive tasks are shown below:

* Artificial Intelligence of Enemies
    * Understanding the ImpactJS Game loop 
    * Graphics for Enemies
* Powerup System
    * Various powerups
    * Powerup transitions when getting hit
* Collectible Items
    * Coins
    * Free lives
* Ability to transition between levels
    * Ability to have different songs per level
* Ability to use pipes to transition to levels
* Sloped tile movement
* Level building
    * Asset gathering

I decided to give each member of my team 1-2 different enemies each week to work on, while providing a skeleton file containing the animation frames already set up, as well as detailed descriptions of enemy behavior coupled with videos of demonstration for those not familiar with Super Mario World. In the meantime, I would work on various systems such as the powerups, collectible items, level building and other things critical to the gameplay itself.

#### Challenges and Experiences

Overall, Super Mario World Koopa Krisis was a huge success. Along with my group, I gained a lot of experience with JavaScript and learned more of the advantages of Object Oriented Programming firsthand, along with becoming more familiar with the ImpactJS Game Engine. 

The biggest challenges faced during this project revolved around transitioning between different game states (a main game and an overworld state), as well as working around the limitations of ImpactJS's `sound` class. One big challenge I personally faced was leading a large group and being able to break down tasks to their most basic form, as well as giving primer lessons on the game engine and JavaScript. In the end, it was a great experience for me as a leader on a project and helped push me to write clean, efficient code for others to understand, while learning as much as possible to pass it on to my dedicated members. 

In the end, our group stayed together and we decided to tackle a far more complex game, a remake of Fire Emblem - Blazing Sword from the Game Boy Advanced.
