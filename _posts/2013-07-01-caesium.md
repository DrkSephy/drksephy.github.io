A real time notification system built using NodeJS and Redis. The motivation for this project is to integrate it into `Graphyte`, an ongoing research project under my current mentor at The City College of New York. Before diving into Caesium, some context about Graphyte is needed.

#### Graphyte - The Scientific Collaboration Tool

Graphyte is a platform built by G.L.A.S.S Lab at The City College of New York to allow collaborators in any scientific collaborations to share their source code, data and computational artifacts with one another within a unified-looking environment. It currently consists of the following sub-systems:

* Graphyte Core System (GCS)
* Graphyte-CLI: Command Line Interface using Graphyte
* Kalium: Simple data store 
* Aurum: GCS Client for creating unit-test based assessments for learning
* Aurum-cli: Command line interface with the Aurum API
* Aurum-Web: Web based interface for packaging scorm modules
* Aurum-js: JavaScript client library for scorm modules using Aurum
* Repoman: Wrapper for working with different repo-hosts (mercurial, git, scm-manager)
* Canary: Wrapper for input/output data blobs to use (Kalium, EC2, OpenStack)
* Caesium: A real time notification system used for debugging and notifying progress of a job being run

At a high level, Graphyte is currently being used for automated learning through the use of an Learning Management System (Aurum) through the Blackboard client. By creating scorm modules, a student can submit their code to the exercise on Blackboard, where their code is sent through a distributed computing network through the use of `Condor`. After the result is returned up through `Condor`, `GCS` and `Aurum`, respectfully, the student recieves a report based on what tests they passed and failed through the unit tests.
