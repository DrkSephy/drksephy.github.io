A real time notification system built using NodeJS and Redis. The motivation for this project is to integrate it into `Graphyte`, an ongoing research project under my current mentor at The City College of New York. Before diving into Caesium, some context about Graphyte is needed.

#### Graphyte - The Scientific Collaboration Tool

Graphyte is a platform built by G.L.A.S.S Lab at The City College of New York to allow collaborators in any scientific collaborations to share their source code, data and computational artifacts with one another within a unified-looking environment. It currently consists of the following sub-systems:

* Graphyte Core System (GCS)
* Graphyte-CLI: Command Line Interface using Graphyte
* Kalium: Simple data store 
* Aurum: GCS Client for creating unit-test based assessments for learning
* Aurum-cli: Command line interface with the Aurum API
* Aurum-Web: Web based interface for packaging scorm modules
* Aurum-js: JavaScript client library for scorm modules using Aurum
* Repoman: Wrapper for working with different repo-hosts (mercurial, git, scm-manager)
* Canary: Wrapper for input/output data blobs to use (Kalium, EC2, OpenStack)
* Caesium: A real time notification system used for debugging and notifying progress of a job being run

At a high level, Graphyte is currently being used for automated learning through the use of an Learning Management System (Aurum) through the Blackboard client. By creating scorm modules, a student can submit their code to the exercise on Blackboard, where their code is sent through a distributed computing network through the use of `Condor`. After the result is returned up through `Condor`, `GCS` and `Aurum`, respectfully, the student recieves a report based on what tests they passed and failed through the unit tests.

#### Inception of Caesium - The Reactive API

Where does the name Caesium come from? As seen from all other systems in our lab, Caesium also takes its name from chemical names. Caesium is a very reactive element, and therefore it was the perfect name for a system which sends notifications in real time based on a triggered event. 

Due to the complexity of Graphyte, it is tough to debug across several web applications working in unison with each other. Sometimes the student's code does not get saved into the database, and sometimes internal errors occur which can't always be tracked. To help solve this problem, Caesium can be used to send notifications to the student while their code is being ran inside of the scorm module on Blackboard. On top of this, a progress bar can be displayed which will allow the user to track the progress of their job and to be able to report exactly where an error occurs in the stacktrace.
