Throughout the construction of this page, I thought it would be very helpful to record the creation of this page for future references. This tutorial will also be used to teach students within the CCNY ACM how to build their own personal portfolios. If you would like to build your own webpage like this one, continue reading!

#### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, static site generator. It uses a template directory which contains raw text files in various formats (either markdown or html), and runs it through `Markdown` (or `textile`) and `Liquid` converters, and outputs a static website ready to be served. Jekyll is also the engine behind Github Pages, and in this tutorial I will be demonstrating how to host your portfolio using `github pages`.

#### Installing Jekyll

In order to start, first you'll need to install jekyll via Ruby Gems. To install Jekyll, simply type into your terminal: `gem install jekyll`. To test a working configuation of Jekyll, perform the following steps:

{% highlight bash %}

    ~ $ gem install jekyll
    ~ $ jekyll new myblog
    ~ $ cd myblog
    ~/myblog $ jekyll serve
    # => Browse page at http://0.0.0.0:4000
{% endhighlight %}

If you were successful in serving up that page, then we're ready to move onto the next step.

#### Building your own portfolio

Now that we have jekyll up and running, we are ready to start our portfolio. Starting out, first navigate to a directory where you would like to store your files. For the sake of this tutorial, I'll be working within the `documents` subfolder.

{% highlight bash %}
    ~ $ cd Documents
    ~ $ mkdir portfolio
{% endhighlight %}

#### Creating _config.yml

Jekyll uses a `_config.yml` file for setting up configurations that will be used across your site. For the sake of this tutorial, we will simply create `_config.yml` as shown below:

{% highlight bash %}
    ~/portfolio $ vim _config.yml 
{% endhighlight %}

Inside of this file we will simply put in:

{% highlight python %}
    markdown: kramdown
{% endhighlight %}

The reason for this is that the `Maruku` interpreter for Markdown has been deprecated, so we now use the `kramdown` interpreter.

#### Choosing a Jekyll Theme

In this tutorial, I'll be using the minimalistic theme. To put get it up and running, do the following:

{% highlight bash %}
    ~/portfolio $ mkdir js
    ~/portfolio $ mkdir css
{% endhighlight %}

Now we create a javascript file called `scale.fix.js`. 

{% highlight bash %}
{% endhighlight %}
