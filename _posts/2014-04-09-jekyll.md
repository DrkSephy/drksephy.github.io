This tutorial will also be used to teach students within the CCNY ACM how to build their own personal portfolios. If you would like to build your own webpage like this one, continue reading!

#### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, static site generator. It uses a template directory which contains raw text files in various formats (either markdown or html), and runs it through `Markdown` (or `textile`) and `Liquid` converters, and outputs a static website ready to be served. Jekyll is also the engine behind Github Pages, and in this tutorial I will be demonstrating how to host your portfolio using `github pages`.

#### Installing Jekyll

In order to start, first you'll need to install jekyll via Ruby Gems. To install Jekyll, simply type into your terminal: `gem install jekyll`.
