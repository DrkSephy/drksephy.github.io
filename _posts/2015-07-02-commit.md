February 19th, 2014 - the day the streak began. I started working on a project called <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://github.com/chessmasterhong/WaterEmblem">Water Emblem </a> alongside my good friend <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://github.com/chessmasterhong">Kevin Chan</a>. At the time we didn't know how long or how much effort would be put into this project, but it quickly grew into the largest project ever created, and lead to the start of the streak which would continue to on for 500 days and more afterwards. Throughout this blog post, I'll be backtracking through project highlights and the benefits of coding everyday. 

#### Water Emblem

<a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://github.com/chessmasterhong/WaterEmblem">Water Emblem</a> is a remake of <a style="color:#FC645F" href="http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_Rekka_no_Ken">Rekka No Ken</a>, a turn-based tactical role playing strategy game in which the game player controls an army of units, similar to a game of Chess. At the start of development, we weren't sure which direction the game would go. It required <a style="color:#FC645F" href="https://github.com/chessmasterhong/WaterEmblem/blob/master/notes/task_tree.txt">many features</a> in a short amount of time, and our experience with building such a complex game was limited. Fire Emblem was my dream game to re-create, and I quickly became fixated on coming as close as possible to the actual game. Minutes turned to hours which turned to days and so on - until months passed. 

During this time period, I coded each and every day building out new features for the game. Some days I would code for 12 to 14 hours, working on the next big feature. This project was by far the first one to truly interest me and get me into programming side-projects, and I attribute it to the start of the streak. My thirst for knowledge kept rolling on, and over the course of 6 straight months I developed features for Water Emblem and clocked in well over 1,500 hours in total writing code, developing wireframes and prototypes.
