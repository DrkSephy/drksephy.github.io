Throughout Spring 2013 - Fall 2014, I have taken part in building three games using the ImpactJS Game Engine within the City College of New York's Game development club. As the Game Development club begins to meet in Fall 2014, I have decided to pass on my knowledge and experiences through giving a presentation on getting started with ImpactJS and developing your first game with it. As such, this tutorial serves as an in-depth, step-by-step guide to building your very own platforming game. 


#### Why ImpactJS?

At the start of the Game Development club in Spring 2013 (back when there was only a single team), we were experimenting with several game engines at the time. After spending a few weeks trying out various frameworks and building simple games, we realized how much functionality would have to be built just to create a simple game. These features revolved around player physics, camera options, enemies/artificial intelligence, level transitioning, and most of all: collision. At that time, building our own game framework was not an option - which is when we stumbled upon ImpactJS. 

ImpactJS provides all of the features noted above and more, exposing easy methods for creating entities (players, enemies), level transitioning, camera functionalities and collision. To top it all off, ImpactJS comes with its own Tile Editor - Weltmeister. Weltmeister provides an easy to use interface for loading level assets, adding/removing layers, setting up collisions, and exporting the level for use within ImpactJS itself. At the moment, ImpactJS costs a hefty $100, but if you can get over the cost then you've got your hands on a very powerful game engine. 

#### Skills / Pre-requisites 

To get the most of this tutorial, you should have some understanding of the following:

* Basic knowledge of JavaScript (Types, pointers, scope)
* Basic usage of your terminal (Navigating directories, creating folders and files)

Knowledge of using your terminal is not required (as you can create files manually), but it is recommended to learn. Throughout this tutorial, I will often use bash commands native to UNIX systems (Mac OS X, Linux).

{% endhighlight %}

Please note that the following files are provided for you upon downloading ImpactJS: `weltmeister.html`, `index.html`, `impact folder`, `weltmeister folder`. 

#### Directory setup


First, we create a root folder for our project, as well as other necessary folders. 

{% highlight bash %}

$ mkdir tutorial
$ cd tutorial
~/tutorial $ mkdir lib
~/tutorial $ mkdir media
~/tutorial $ mkdir lib/game
~/tutorial $ mkdir lib/game/entities
~/tutorial $ mkdir lib/game/levels

{% endhighlight %}

Within the root folder `tutorial`, place `weltmeister.html` (received from purchasing ImpactJS), `server.py` (obtained from <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/amadeus/python-impact" > here </a>), and `index.html` (also received from purchasing ImpactJS). Within `tutorial/lib`, place the `impact` and `weltmeister` folders. Lastly, you may obtain all of the media for this project <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/DrkSephy/ACM-Game-Presentation" > here </a>. 

ImpactJS will look for two things when loading a game: a `main.js` file within `lib/game` and `impact.js` inside `lib/impact`. These are referenced within `index.html`, which is the file that gets served by our web server, `server.py`. These directories can be changed as needed, so long as the updated changes are reflected within `index.html`.

#### Understanding ImpactJS game loop

With all of our directories in place, we move onto building our main game file, `main.js`. 

{% highlight bash %}

~/tutorial $ cd lib/game
~/tutorial/lib/game $ vim main.js 

{% endhighlight %}

Within `main.js`, we require any modules needed in the game (all entities, levels and plugins), set up key bindings, camera settings, draw to the screen, and initialize our game instance. The full content of `main.js` is shown below:

{% highlight javascript %}

ig.module( 
    'game.main' 
)
.requires(
    'impact.game',
    'impact.debug.debug',
    'game.levels.test',
    'game.entities.player',
    'game.entities.goomba'
)


.defines(function(){

MyGame = ig.Game.extend({
    
    // Load a font
    font: new ig.Font( 'media/04b03.font.png' ),
    
    gravity: 300,
    init: function() {
        // Initialize your game here; bind keys etc.

        //Create key bindings
        ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.LEFT_ARROW, 'left');
        ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.RIGHT_ARROW, 'right');
        ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.X, 'jump');

        // Load our level. Syntax: Level(Level name)
        // Level name must be capitalized, otherwise it won't load!
        this.loadLevel( LevelTest );
    },
    
    update: function() {
        // Update all entities and backgroundMaps
        
        var player = this.getEntitiesByType( EntityPlayer )[0]; 
        if( player ) { 
            this.screen.x = player.pos.x - ig.system.width/2; 
            this.screen.y = player.pos.y - ig.system.height/2; 
        }
        this.parent();
        
        // Add your own, additional update code here
    },
    
    draw: function() {
        // Draw all entities and backgroundMaps
        this.parent();
        if(this.font){
            var player = ig.game.getEntitiesByType('EntityPlayer')[0];
            this.font.draw('Health: ' + player.health, 50, 10, ig.Font.ALIGN.CENTER);
        }
    }
});


    /* The following code passes a reference to the Canvas, which is
    a name for our game instance, and passes the frame rate and size
    into the ig.main constructor. */

    // Start the Game with 60fps, a resolution of 320x240, scaled
    // up by a factor of 2
    ig.main( '#canvas', MyGame, 60, 320, 240, 2 );

});


{% endhighlight %}

Let's break it down into smaller pieces. When creating `main.js` or any file within `entity`, we are essentially creating `modules` which gets loaded up by our game. 

{% highlight javascript %}

ig.module( 
    'game.main' 
)
.requires(
    'impact.game',
    'impact.debug.debug',
    'game.levels.test',
    'game.entities.player',
    'game.entities.goomba'
)

{% endhighlight %}

Within `ig.module`, we are passing in the path to `main.js`, relative to `lib` folder. We then chain to the `ig.module` by calling `requires` and passing in any entities that our game needs to run. Here, we include `impact.game` (the core game logic of ImpactJS), `impact.debug.debug` (built-in debug panel, covered later), `game.levels.test` (our first level, which we have not built yet), `game.entities.player` (our player entity, not implemented yet) and lastly `game.entities.goomba` (our enemy entity, which will be implemented shortly). Whenever we create new entities, we must be sure to include them within `requires` otherwise an error will be thrown inside of your browser about missing files from `main.js` and your level. 

Next, we chain `defines` to begin creating our first game class, `MyGame`. We can create multiple game classes, useful for creating title screens and game over screens. For now, we focus on just a single main class. 

{% highlight javascript %}

MyGame = ig.Game.extend({
    
});

    /* The following code passes a reference to the Canvas, which is
     * a name for our game instance, and passes the frame rate and size
     * into the ig.main constructor. 

     * Start the Game with 60fps, a resolution of 320x240, scaled
     * up by a factor of 2 */
    ig.main( '#canvas', MyGame, 60, 320, 240, 2 );

});

{% endhighlight %}

Here we define our `MyGame` class, which `extends` the built-in `ig.Game` class. This simply means that our `MyGame` class inherits all functionality from ImpactJS `Game` class, giving us access to physics properties and several helper functions. Lastly, we initialize our game instance by drawing to the `#canvas` div, passing in our `MyGame` class with `60fps` and resolution `320 x 240` scaled by a factor of `2`. An instance of setting properties is shown below: 

{% highlight javascript %}

// load any images, fonts or sounds here
// load path to our bitmap font
font: new ig.Font( 'media/04b03.font.png' ),

// Physics property provided by ig.Game
gravity: 300,

{% endhighlight %}
We now move on to definining our key bindings through our `init` function. As the name would imply, `init` is run once and once only - meaning that you should not put any logic within it which you expect to update. The `init` function is good for binding keys, setting up temporary variables for use in other functions, etc.

{% highlight javascript %}

init: function() {
    // Initialize your game here; bind keys etc.

    //Create key bindings
    ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.LEFT_ARROW, 'left');
    ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.RIGHT_ARROW, 'right');
    ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.X, 'jump');

    // Load our level. Syntax: Level(Level name)
    // Level name must be capitalized, otherwise it won't load!
    this.loadLevel( LevelTest );
},

{% endhighlight %}

One of the major functions within `main.js` and any entity file is it's `update` function. Unlike `init`, the `update` function will run once per frame -meaning it will run 60 times per second if you configured your game to run in 60fps. Inside of `update` you would do things like update behavior of entities, load levels, set up the camera, etc. 

{% highlight javascript %}

update: function() {
    // Update all entities and backgroundMaps

    // Get an instance of our player
    var player = this.getEntitiesbsByType( EntityPlayer )[0]; 
    if( player ) { 
        this.screen.x = player.pos.x - ig.system.width/2; 
        this.screen.y = player.pos.y - ig.system.height/2; 
    }
    this.parent();
    
    // Add your own, additional update code here
},

{% endhighlight %}

Here we grab an instance of our `player` entity by name `EntityPlayer`. This will become clearer once we implement the player entity. Next, if our player exists, we make the camera follow the player by setting the position of the screen to be that of the player's position relative to the actual size of the game (`ig.system.width`, `ig.system.height`).

Lastly, we move onto the draw function.

{% highlight javascript %}

draw: function() {
    // Draw all entities and backgroundMaps
    this.parent();
    if(this.font){
        var player = ig.game.getEntitiesByType('EntityPlayer')[0];
        this.font.draw('Health: ' + player.health, 50, 10, ig.Font.ALIGN.CENTER);
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Like `update`, the `draw` function will be called on every frame. It is very important to make sure that you are not drawing multiple instances of the same object, otherwise your browser will crash due to the number of draws to the canvas. As such, always perform a check shown below:

{% highlight javascript %}
draw: function(){
    if(object_to_draw === undefined){
        // Draw stuff here
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will check to see if we have drawn the object in question, and make sure no duplicates are spawned. Going back to our original draw code, we simply grab an instance of our player through the `ig.game.getEntitiesByType` method, and then access the player's health through `player.health` and draw it to the screen using an instance of our `font` which we loaded earlier. 

#### Creating Player Entity

After finishing `main.js`, the first part in any major game is our player. 

{% highlight bash %}
~/tutorial/lib/game/entities $ vim player.js
{% endhighlight %}

The contents of `player.js` is shown below:

{% highlight javascript %}

ig.module(
    'game.entities.player'
    )
.requires(
    'impact.entity'
    )
.defines(function(){
    EntityPlayer = ig.Entity.extend({

        type: ig.Entity.TYPE.A,
        checkAgainst: ig.Entity.TYPE.NONE,
        collides: ig.Entity.COLLIDES.ACTIVE,

        animSheet: new ig.AnimationSheet('media/player.png', 16, 28),
        size: {x: 16, y: 28},
        offset: {x: 1, y: 0},
        flip: true,
        maxVel: {x: 100, y: 160},
        friction: {x: 500, y: 0},
        accelGround: 200,
        accelAir: 310,
        jump: 360,
        gravity: 300,
        
        init: function(x, y, settings){
            this.parent(x, y, settings);
            this.addAnim('idle', 1, [1]);
            this.addAnim('run', 0.10, [1, 0]);
            this.addAnim('jump', 1, [2]);
            this.addAnim('fall', 0.4, [2]);
        },

        update: function() {
            // Add left/right/jump movement logic
            var accel = this.standing ? this.accelGround : this.accelAir;
            if(ig.input.state('left')) {
                this.accel.x = -accel;
                this.flip = false;
            } else if(ig.input.state('right')) {
                this.accel.x = accel;
                this.flip = true;
            } else
            this.accel.x = 0;

            if(this.standing && ig.input.state('jump')) {
                if(this.vel.y == 0) {
                    this.vel.y = -this.jump;
                    this.falling = false;
                }
            }
            // CASE 2: Player not standing, jump has been released and we're not falling
            // we reduce the y velocity by 66% and mark us as falling
            else if(!this.standing && !ig.input.state('jump') && !this.falling) {
                this.vel.y = Math.floor(this.vel.y/3);
                this.falling = true;
            }

            // Add moving logic
            this.currentAnim.flip.x = this.flip;

            this.parent();


            if(this.vel.y < 0 && !this.standing)
                this.currentAnim = this.anims.jump;
            else if(this.vel.y > 0 && !this.standing)
                this.currentAnim = this.anims.fall;
            else if(this.vel.x != 0)
                this.currentAnim = this.anims.run;
            else
                this.currentAnim = this.anims.idle;
        }, 

    });
});

{% endhighlight %}

As with `main.js`, we begin by defining our player module:

{% highlight javascript %}
ig.module(
    'game.entities.player'
    )
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the module name must match that of the file name (in this case, `player`.js). Next, we require the files needed for this entity:

{% highlight javascript %}
.requires(
    'impact.entity'
    )
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we require `impact.entity`, which is part of the ImpactJS source code. By requiring `impact.entity`, we are using it to define our own entity, `player`. This is reflected below, where we instantiate our player entity within `defines`:

{% highlight javascript %}

.defines(function(){
    EntityPlayer = ig.Entity.extend({

});

{% endhighlight %}

Here, our player entity will derive from the `ig.Entity` class. It is important to note that defining an entity follows the naming convention:

{% highlight javascript %}
Entity<Filename_without_extension> 
{% endhighlight %}

Where `Entity` is always attached to the name of the file (in this case, `player`.js, without the .js extension), case sensitive.

By extending our entity from the `ig.Entity` class, we have access to several properties and methods, which we have used to define behavior of our player. Let's go over those in greater detail. 

{% highlight javascript %}

type: ig.Entity.TYPE.A,
checkAgainst: ig.Entity.TYPE.NONE,
collides: ig.Entity.COLLIDES.ACTIVE,

{% endhighlight %}

These lines help us easily set up collisions between entities in ImpactJS. It is a convention to set up all *friendly* entities `TYPE.A`, and all *unfriendly* entities `TYPE.B`. When two entities overlap each other in the game world, the `.checkAgainst` property of one entity will match the `.type` of the other one, which in turn calls the former entities `.check()` method  with the latter entity as the parameter. This allows damage to be given/received based on these properties. Lastly, the `collides` property determines which entity moves after colliding with another entity in the game world. 

<i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> <a href="http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#collides">Read Entity Documentation</a>

Moving onto the next set of properties, the comments should be self-explanatory. For more detailed explanations, you may view the documentation above. 

{% highlight javascript %}
// Create a new animation sheet, containing the path to the image, width and height. 
animSheet: new ig.AnimationSheet('media/player.png', 16, 28),

// Set up the collision-bounding box of entity
size: {x: 16, y: 28},

// Offset the collision-bounding box
offset: {x: 1, y: 0},

// Should we flip the image?
flip: true,

// Max x, y velocity of entity
maxVel: {x: 100, y: 160},

// Deceleration subtracted from velocity per second
friction: {x: 500, y: 0},

// How fast to accel while on the ground per second
accelGround: 200,

// How fast to accel in the air per second
accelAir: 310,

// How high to jump
jump: 360,

// How much we are affected by gravity
gravity: 300,

{% endhighlight %}

Next we define our animation frames for our player entity. 

{% highlight javascript %}

init: function(x, y, settings){
    this.parent(x, y, settings);
    this.addAnim('idle', 1, [1]);
    this.addAnim('run', 0.10, [1, 0]);
    this.addAnim('jump', 1, [2]);
    this.addAnim('fall', 0.4, [2]);
},

{% endhighlight %}

Here we create each animation that we want for our player entity denoted by the string parameter, followed by the time each frame will run and lastly the frames to iterate over. If no fourth parameter is provided, the frames will loop around indefinitely. The frames are split up and referenced based on the values passed into the `animSheet` property we set above. 

<i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> <a href="http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#addanim">Read Animation Documentation</a>

The last portion of our player entity is the `update` method, which we will break up into pieces for clarity.

{% highlight javascript %}

update: function() {
    // Add left/right/jump movement logic
    var accel = this.standing ? this.accelGround : this.accelAir;
    if(ig.input.state('left')) {
        this.accel.x = -accel;
        this.flip = false;
    } else if(ig.input.state('right')) {
        this.accel.x = accel;
        this.flip = true;
    } else
        this.accel.x = 0;

{% endhighlight %}

As mentioned earlier, the `update` method is where we define how our entity behaves. Since the `update` method is run once per frame, we can use it to adjust the player's velocity based on the user input to move the player entity. Here we flip the entity's animation and adjust the acceleration based on the key bindings. 

We have only handled left and right movement, but we still need to handle jump inputs.

{% highlight javascript %}

if(this.standing && ig.input.state('jump')) {
    if(this.vel.y == 0) {
        this.vel.y = -this.jump;
        this.falling = false;
    }
}

// CASE 2: Player not standing, jump has been released and we're not falling
// we reduce the y velocity by 66% and mark us as falling
else if(!this.standing && !ig.input.state('jump') && !this.falling) {
    this.vel.y = Math.floor(this.vel.y/3);
    this.falling = true;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Here the `standing` property of our entity is checked along with the input state. If the player is standing and jump input has been made, we alter `y-velocity` based on the `jump` property of our player. Lastly, we set `this.falling` to be false, which is a property built in explicity into all entities through `ig.Entity`. For the second case, we check that the player is in the air already, and if so then we decrease the velocity as it begins to fall. 

Lastly, we handle displaying the proper animations based on `velocity` and `.standing`:

{% highlight javascript %}

// Add moving logic
this.currentAnim.flip.x = this.flip;

this.parent();

// When we jump, we set the y-velocity to be negative. 
if(this.vel.y < 0 && !this.standing)
    this.currentAnim = this.anims.jump;

// When we are falling, we set y-velocity to be positive. 
else if(this.vel.y > 0 && !this.standing)
    this.currentAnim = this.anims.fall;

// If our x-velocity is non-zero, we must be running based on previous cases
else if(this.vel.x != 0)
    this.currentAnim = this.anims.run;

// If all other cases are false, we must be standing still. 
else
    this.currentAnim = this.anims.idle;

{% endhighlight %}

We have now finished our Player Entity! A game wouldn't be any fun without enemies to beat up, so our next step is to implement our `goomba` entity. 

{% highlight bash %}
~/tutorial/lib/game/entities $ vim goomba.js
{% endhighlight %}

For reference, the completed `goomba.js` file is shown below. 

{% highlight javascript %}

ig.module(
    'game.entities.goomba'
)

});

For the most part, the setup should be the same as `player.js`. There are some methods that are new here, so let's go over those. 

{% highlight javascript %}
handleMovementTrace: function(res){
    this.parent(res);
    // If this entity collides with the collision map,
    // flip the animation. 
    if(res.collision.x){
        console.log(this.flip);
        this.flip = !this.flip;
        this.anims.crawl.flip.x = !this.flip;
    }
},
{% endhighlight %}

`handleMovementTrace` tracks collisions between this entity and the collisonMap, which is the collision layer of the level itself. Based on how it is colliding with the collisionMap, we flip the animation so the entity faces the right direction. 

<i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> <a href="http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#handlemovementtrace">Read Animation Documentation</a>

{% highlight javascript %}

collideWith: function(other, axis){
    if(other instanceof EntityPlayer){
        if(axis === 'y'){
            this.kill();
        }
        else { 
            other.receiveDamage(1, this);
        }
    }
},

{% endhighlight %}

This method should be self-explanatory due to the name, except that it tracks collisions between this entity and other entities. Based on the axis of collision, we determine if we should kill this entity (if collision occured on the y-axis), or damage the opposing entity (collision occured on the x-axis).  

{% highlight javascript %}

check: function(other){
    other.receiveDamage(1, this);
},

{% endhighlight %}

Whenever this entity overlaps with another in the game world, the latter entity is passed as the parameter to `check` and we call Impact's `receiveDamage` method on it to apply damage. 

<i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> <a href="http://impactjs.com/documentation/class-reference/entity#check">Read Animation Documentation</a>

{% highlight javascript %}

kill: function(){
    this.parent();
},

{% endhighlight %}

When an entities `health` property is reduced to 0, we call `ig.Entity` kill method through `this.parent()` to remove it from the game world. `this.parent()` will refer to the object that this entity inherits from, i.e: `ig.Entity` base class which contains the `kill` method. It is important to notice that we never explicity defined a `health` property; this is also inherited from `ig.Entity` base class.

{% highlight javascript %}

receiveDamage: function(value){
    this.parent(value);
},

{% endhighlight %}

As with `kill`, whenever there is a collison between two entities in the game world, we call `this.parent(value)` to call `ig.Entity` receiveDamage method and apply the damage. 

With that, we have now completed both a player and an enemy entity. Before we finish building our game, how about we add a simple powerup entity for our player to collect?

{% highlight bash %}

~/tutorial/lib/game/entities $ mushroom.js

{% endhighlight %}

For the sake of demonstration, the mushroom powerup will increase the player's health by 10 upon collision. The code for the mushroom entity is shown below:

{% highlight javascript %}

ig.module(
    'game.entities.mushroom'
)
.requires(
    'impact.entity'
)
.defines(function(){
    EntityMushroom = ig.Entity.extend({
        size: {x: 16, y: 16},
        maxVel: {x: 100, y: 100},
        speed: 50,
        gravity: 10,
        gravityFactor: 1,
        collides: ig.Entity.COLLIDES.NONE,
        type: ig.Entity.TYPE.B,
        checkAgainst: ig.Entity.TYPE.A,
        animSheet: new ig.AnimationSheet('media/mushroom.png', 16, 16),

        init: function(x, y, settings){
            this.parent(x, y, settings);
            this.addAnim('idle', 1, [0]);
        },

        update: function(){
            var xdir = this.flip ? -1 : 1;
            this.vel.x = this.speed * xdir;
            this.parent();
        },

        handleMovementTrace: function(res){
            this.parent(res);
            if(res.collision.x){
                this.flip = !this.flip;
                this.anims.idle.flip.x = this.flip;
            }
        },

        check: function(other){
            other.receiveDamage(-10, this);
            this.kill();
        },
    });
});

{% endhighlight %}

The implementation should seem very straightforward - most of the code comes directly from `goomba.js`. The only change is within the `check` method, which applies negative damage to the player upon collision, which in turn heals the player since it is doing negative damage. 

Now that we have implemented all of our game entities, all that is left is a level to play. To do so, navigate to the url provided by running `server.py`: `http://localhost:8080/editor` and begin building your level. This tutorial will not cover building levels using Weltmeister, as there are already resources and videos that give great explanations. See below for links to these resources.

If you want to grab a test level, you may do so <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/DrkSephy/ACM-Game-Presentation/tree/master/lib/game/levels">here</a> and drop it inside of `lib/game/levels`.
