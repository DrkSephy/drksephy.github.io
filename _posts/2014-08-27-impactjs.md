Throughout Spring 2013 - Fall 2014, I have taken part in building three games using the ImpactJS Game Engine within the City College of New York's Game development club. As the Game Development club begins to meet in Fall 2014, I have decided to pass on my knowledge and experiences through giving a presentation on getting started with ImpactJS and developing your first game with it. As such, this tutorial serves as an in-depth, step-by-step guide to building your very own platforming game.
