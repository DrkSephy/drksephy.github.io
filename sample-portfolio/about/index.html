        <hr>
        <p> Welcome to my personal web page! My name is David, I am currently a senior
            studying Computer Engineering at the City College of New York. I'll be
            attending graduate school to further my studies in Computer Science. 
            I currently lead the CCNY ACM Game Development group. </p>

        <p>I started programming in 2009. Programming is my passion, I can easily get 
            lost in it for days at a time. My areas of interest are Crytpography, 
            Machine Learning, Web Development, Game Development and Computer Vision.</p>

        <p>I've worked on a few research projects, both in hardware and software. My 
            previous research experiences involved building customized quadcopters 
            meant for creating 3D maps of urban areas, alongside software for processing
            and generating the map data gathered through cameras, sensors and lasers.</p>
