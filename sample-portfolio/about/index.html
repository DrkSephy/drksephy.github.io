        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Welcome to my personal web page! My name is David, I am currently a senior
            studying Computer Engineering at the City College of New York. I'll be
            attending graduate school to further my studies in Computer Science. 
            I currently lead the CCNY ACM Game Development group. </p>

        <p>I started programming in 2009. Programming is my passion, I can easily get 
            lost in it for days at a time. My areas of interest are Crytpography, 
            Machine Learning, Web Development, Game Development and Computer Vision.</p>

        <p>I've worked on a few research projects, both in hardware and software. My 
            previous research experiences involved building customized quadcopters 
            meant for creating 3D maps of urban areas, alongside software for processing
            and generating the map data gathered through cameras, sensors and lasers.</p>

        <h1>Skillset</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>My strongest languages are Python, C, and JavaScript. I'm capable of learning enough about a new language to get by in only a few weeks.</p>

        <h3>Frameworks and APIs</h3>
        <p>I have experience developing web applications using Django, Pyramid, NodeJS, 
            jQuery and EmberJS, as well as a multitude of other JavaScript frameworks. 
            I also have experience with using APIs to develop both Web and Mobile 
            applications</p>

        <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>I have strong software development skills. I write efficient, clean code
            while adhering to principles of DRY. I can get familar with large and complicated
            codebases in a short amount of time. My skills in software engineering also include unit testing in both Python and JavaScript, issue tracking and version
            control systems with Git or Mercurial.</p>

        <h3>Databases</h3>
        I have experience in designing applications backed with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, 
        SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Redis.
