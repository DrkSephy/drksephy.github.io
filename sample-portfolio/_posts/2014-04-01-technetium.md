Technetium is a Bitbucket Data aggregation tool built using Bitbucket's RESTful API. Features a centalized issue tracker, repository subscription manager, and reports/graphs which enumerates the commit/issue activity of each user in a subscribed repository.

#### Conception

As required from my Web Design class which I took in Fall 2013, a web application had to be built using either Django, Flask or Pyramid. After spending a few weeks in the Summer brainstorming various API's to use in our project, my team of two came across the Bitbucket API - it provided a rich set of endpoints and methods for accessing various data in a repository.  

Another inspiration for the project was a centralized issue tracker - something that we desperately needed within the research lab I have worked in since Summer 2013. With a 
large amount of web applications being built and numerous issues piling up in each one, it was necessary to create a way for a project manager to easily keep up to date with the progress of each project and to track work being done.
