Fire Emblem - Chronicles of the Abyss is a JavaScript remake of Fire Emblem - Blazing Sword built on top of the ImpactJS Game Engine, purely for educational purposes. The motivation for this project is to explore the capabilities of ImpactJS and push the boundaries of the engine, as well as to create a long-time favorite game. 

#### The Beginning

Through my experiences with ImpactJS, this new project is out of the scope of the engine. ImpactJS was built for simple, side-scrolling platforming games, while Fire Emblem is a top-down turn based strategy role playing game in which the player controls an army of units, not just a single player. 

Before the project officially began as a group, one of my team members started to work on the core battle system of the game - to see if it was feasible to build this game. After a month of work, it turned out that it was entirely possible to build this game, and that it would take an incredible amount of work. Nonetheless, we began on the second week of February after we assembled a team of 5.
