        <h1>Works in Progress</h1>
        <p>Welcome! On this page you will find any and all projects that I am currently working on - from research projects to class/side projects.</p>

        <h2>Caesium</h2>
        <h4>JavaScript &#x2022; Node.js &#x2022; Redis &#x2022; Python &#x2022; Socket.io </h4>

        <p>A real-time notification system built for integration into Graphyte, an ongoing 
            research project at the G.L.A.S.S Lab at the City College of New York.</p>

        <p> By using Node.js in combination with both its socket.io and redis client, a simple
            notification streaming system can be built using Redis's pubsub implementation.
            Whenever a new client is connected to Graphyte, they are automatically subscribed
            to a new channel through the Node.js Redis client, and can then recieve messages
            in real-time to get feedback on their homework solutions.</p>

        <h2>Sea Ice Mapping</h2>
        <h4>Python &#x2022; Numpy &#x2022; Scipy &#x2022; Theano &#x2022; Deep Learning</h4>

        <p>A joint research project with NOAA-CREST and NASA to map sea ice structures on satellite images provided by MODIS. My roles involve getting training data through
        marking up supplied images, as well as exploring more automated classification methods
        using various Deep Learning algorithms built on top of Theano. </p>
